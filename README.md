# Projects #

## [Navigation-Algorithms Repo](https://github.com/tcmilleriii/Navigation-Algorithms) ##
I enjoy familiarizing myself with common algorithms in the localization space / navigation realm, so do please stop by this repo if that interests you.<br/>

## [Common Algorithms Repo](https://github.com/tcmilleriii/Common-Software-Algos) ##
A more generalized set of algorithms that I consider "essential" in the software engineering world. These are to have, hold, cherish, and sometimes crack open to study.

## Dungeons and Dragons ##
Laugh it up, I'm a Dungeon Master. But I have a lot of fun messing around in Blender using [Hero Forge Characters](https://www.heroforge.com/) for my players. What better place to store my silly DnD things than my github.
